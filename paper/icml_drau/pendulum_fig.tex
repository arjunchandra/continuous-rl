	\caption{Policies obtained by DDPG and AU at different instants in physical time (or normalized epochs) of training on the pendulum swing-up environment. Each image represents the policy learnt by the policy network, with $x$-axis representing angle, and $y$-axis angular velocity. The lighter the pixel, the closer to $1$ the action, the darker, the closer to $-1$.}
