\begin{abstract}
Despite remarkable successes, \emph{Deep Reinforcement Learning}
(DRL) is not robust to hyperparameterization, implementation
details, or small environment changes (\citealt{drl_matter},
\citealt{drl_matter_bis}).  Overcoming such sensitivity is key to
making DRL applicable to real world problems.  In this paper,
we identify
sensitivity to \emph{time discretization} in near
continuous-time environments as a critical factor; this covers, e.g., changing the number of
frames per second, or the action frequency of the controller.
Empirically, we find that
Q-learning-based approaches such as
\emph{Deep Q-learning}~\cite{dqn} and \emph{Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient}~\cite{ddpg} %are highly sensitive to variations of time discretization and
collapse with small time steps. Formally, we prove that
$Q$-learning does not exist in
continuous time.
We detail a principled way to build an
off-policy RL algorithm that yields similar performances over a wide range
of time
discretizations, and confirm this robustness empirically. 
% We further show that a simple reparameterization of the
% Q-function as a sum of a state value term and a \emph{small}
% action dependent advantage term yields an algorithm much more
% resilient to variations of time discretization.\LB{Change last
% sentence to: We introduce a more resilient algorithm to
% variations of time discretization [We could say more, but still
% less that what is already there]}
